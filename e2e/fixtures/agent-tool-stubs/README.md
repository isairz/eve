# Declarative tool stub verification

This fixture runs consumer evals with every real model in the `e2e-local`
matrix (`modelMatrix: full`). The tasks journey uses a semantic judge to
distinguish acknowledging a completed task from listing it as still open;
it carries the `real-model` tag. Matching and cross-turn playback also run
with the shared scripted responder in the Postgres and Vercel world suites.
A passing scripted world run is transport/durability evidence, not live-model evidence.

The matcher accepts 38 keywords: type, const, enum; five numeric constraints;
three string constraints; eight array constraints; nine object constraints;
seven composition/conditional keywords; and three annotations. `schema.test.ts` names the individual contracts rather than inferring expected
answers from the validator.

Tests use draft 2020-12 semantics, including [contains bounds](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-validation#section-6.4.4),
[decimal multiples](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-validation#section-6.2.1),
and [required properties](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-validation#section-6.5.3).
Regression tests reproduced defects in the vendored validator's default
`minContains`, negative/tiny `multipleOf`, inherited property handling,
object/array equality, and dependency-map traversal before repair. Configuration-size rejection also has a reproduced regression.

This covers every admitted keyword, not every combination of schemas or every
possible model response. Live-model evals verify the model/runtime boundary;
they do not replace deterministic schema conformance tests. Schemas and inputs
are JSON values represented by JavaScript numbers; precision already lost while
parsing a number cannot be recovered by the matcher.
