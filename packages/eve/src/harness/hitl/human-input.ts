/**
 * Everything a turn waits on from a person: tool approvals, authorizations, the
 * budget question, and requests relayed from child sessions and workflow runs.
 *
 * Rules read a projection of the session machine through beforeStep/afterStep.
 * The adapter folds their commands into a transition and an ordered effect outbox;
 * only the machine's apply persists it. The read/commit host facade below remains
 * solely for compatibility with the legacy rule tests, never for runtime use.
 *
 * Words, one meaning each:
 * - **turn**: it *waits* (`{ waiting: "input" }`, `turn.waiting`), on a
 *   person or on runtime work, until it can continue.
 * - **step**: one model call and its tool calls. It is started, then
 *   completed (the model call is done), then *settled* (every call has a
 *   result), and only then joins history.
 * - **held step**: a completed step that has not settled, kept out of
 *   history. Each rule invocation sees one originating suspended step.
 * - **held call**: a call of the held step that has no result yet.
 * - **request**: something asked of a person; it stays *open* until resolved.
 * - **input**: one thing the session saw at a step boundary (`Input`): from
 *   the step, the inbox, or a relay (a child session or run).
 * - **command**: what the rules tell the host to do (`Command`). An
 *   imperative the host carries out; nothing is reported back.
